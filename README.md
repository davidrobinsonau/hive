# hive ulverstone racktrack timer

Do you know how to program with Python? 
Would you like to look at the track timer Python code?
How about updating it with new and cool functions for everyone to enjoy?

We would love suggestions and code updates.

The track timer consists of:
•	A Raspberry Pi computer with two monitors
•	4 IR (infra-red) beams to see the car start and finish on the track.
